The car industry is now a major target for cyberattacks due to the growing integration of wireless technologies in contemporary automobiles. RF (Radio Frequency) car hacking is one of the most alarming attack methods. It takes use of flaws in wireless communication systems like remote start, keyless entry, and other car control systems.
This manual examines many RF car hacking strategies, highlighting the ways in which attackers compromise vehicle security. These include signal jamming that blocks communication, signal spoofing to mimic approved devices, and relay attacks, which increase the range of key fobs to unlock cars without the owner's consciousness.
This project attempts to give an extensive understanding of the dangers that modern vehicles confront by exploring the technical details of these attacks.
